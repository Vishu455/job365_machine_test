# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This project consist of multiple-step involved Account creation using react.this form includes actually four steps, each representing the slides of different stages of the sign-up process.
1)Account Details: The user provides basic information like name , email, mobile no etc.
2)Educational Details: The user enters educational background information.
3)Document Upload: The user uploads required documents for verification.
4)Create Password: The user sets a password and agrees to terms of service to complete account creation.
each of this slides are done seperately as components and it is really helpful to assemble them into the main app.js file 

KEY FEATURES USED
1)Step-by-Step Navigation: Users can move between steps using next and previous buttons. The progress is visualized through a set of round indicators at the bottom of the form, which update dynamically as the user moves through the form.

2)Password Creation with Toggle Visibility: The last step in the form allows users to create a password. The password and confirm password fields include an eye icon to toggle visibility, helping the user ensure the correct entry.

3)Form Validation: Error messages are shown if:

The password and confirm password do not match.
The user tries to submit without agreeing to the terms of service.
4)size limitation for file uploading where also provided so that certain limited sized can be uploaded.


DESIGN ENHANCEMENTS:

A logo is placed at the top left with some margin for aesthetic balance.
The buttons and indicators at the bottom are positioned in a fixed location to ensure consistent alignment across all slides.
The gap between the next and previous arrow buttons has been minimized for a more compact layout.


TECHNOLOGIES IMPLIMENTED:
1)React: For building the multi-step form with component-based structure.
2)Tailwind CSS: For styling the layout, ensuring responsiveness and a clean, modern UI design.
3)React Icons: For adding the eye icon to toggle password visibility.
Goal of the Project:

The main objective is to create a smooth and user-friendly sign-up experience, ensuring users can easily navigate through each step of the form, validate their inputs, and complete the account creation process without hassle.
the creation of the project also as maximum simple way as possible but made it with reliable and effecient way.each buttons are provided with state with help of react the styled the page for users to be user friendly and user interface exactly as give by the company.folders where structured and components where divided for each specific section of datas to be added.
